    <h2>Daily Blog:Slowly coming together....</h2>


<p> Four weeks have gone by at Grand Circus, and while they've gone by
    incredibly fast, each day early on felt like taking on a hurricane of information.
</p>

<p>
However, with review, help from classmates and teachers and ta's, and grit,
all that knowledge and information is solidfying internally along with a better 
competence and confidence. 
</p>

<h2> Developing </h2>
<p>Learning C# has been interesting because there are so many ways to do different things.</p>
<p>You can do it a straight forward approach of doing it step by step, or by creating methods
that allow you to do the same thing with way less code needed.
</p>

<h2>HomeTown</h2>
<p id = "Hometown p">
I'm from the Novi area and it takes me 
35-40 min to get to Grand Circus each day. When I'm done,
I go home and play guitar like above!
